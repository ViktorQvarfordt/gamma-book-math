# Understanding air conditioning and it's environmental impact

## Fundamentals and cooling capacity

**Energy** comes in different forms, including electricity and heat. Joule is the SI unit of energy.

**Watt** is the SI unit of *energy flow rate*. 1 watt = 1 joule per second.

**Electrical power** can be measured in watts since it is a flow of (electrical) energy. E.g., the flow of electricity from a wall socket.

**Cooling capacity** can be measured in watts since it is a flow of (heat) energy. E.g., the flow of heat that an AC removes from a room. Removing heat is the same as cooling.

**What about energy conservation;** how can cooling capacity be greater than electrical power? An AC uses electrical energy to *displace* heat energy. It moves energy around. It takes energy to do so, but it's perfectly possible to move more energy than you use doing so -- think of a lever.

AC's generally have an efficiency of about 2.5. It removes 2.5 more heat energy than the amount of electrical energy that it consumes. This is in contrast to a heater that converts electrical energy to heat energy. A 1 kW (electrical power) heater can never produce more than 1 kW of heat energy; a fundamental principle of thermodynamics.

## Environmental impact

**CO2 equivalents** is a measure of environmental impact and is useful for comparing different sources.

- Swedish electricity has approximately 0.05 kg CO2 equivalents per kWh (Source: [Naturskyddsföreningen](https://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/sites/default/files/dokument-media/bilaga_1_lagg_om_vaxeln_utslappsnivaer_fran_olika_energislag.pdf)).
- Swedish beef has approximately 28 kg CO2 equivalents per kg. (Source: [WWF](https://www.wwf.se/mat-och-jordbruk/matkalkylator/)).
- Cars emit on average 180 grams of CO2 equivalents per km (Source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200317-climate-change-cut-carbon-emissions-from-your-commute))

Let's make some comparisons:

:::reference[AC]
Maxing a 785 watt AC for 24 hours produces 0.942 kg CO2. (785 W * 24 h * 0.05 kg CO2/kWh = 0.942 kg CO2)
:::

:::example[AC vs beef]
Maxing the AC for 24 hours is equivalent to eating 34 grams of Swedish beef. (0.942 / 28 ≈ 0.034)
:::

:::example[AC vs car]
Maxing the AC for 24 hours is equivalent to driving 5.2 km in an average car. (942 / 180 ≈ 5.2)

Maxing the AC for 24 hours over 16 days has the same environmental impact as a 85 km car ride. (85 * 180 / 942 ≈ 16)
:::

:::example[AC vs Playstation 5]
The AC uses twice as much electricity as gaming on a Playstation 5 (200 W) with a OLED TV (180 W).
:::

:::example[AC vs lamps and heaters]
- Average lamp: 50 W.
- Average electrical radiator: 1000 W.

During Swedish winter one often uses many more lamps and heaters. Powering an AC over summer still results in lower energy consumption compared to the winter.

## Conclusion

One's intuition may indicate that powering an AC has a large environmental impact. This intuition is not correct. Powering an AC has a negligible effect in comparison to other everyday tools and activities.
