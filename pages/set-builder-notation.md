# Set builder notation

:::definition[Set builder notation]
The set builder notation is a notational convenience for constructing new sets. Given a set $A$ and a [function]() $f$ with domain $A$ we define the expression

$$
\{f(a) : a \in A \}
$$

to be the set of all elements on the form $f(a)$ where $a \in A$. The colon in the set builder notation is read "such that". We read the above defined set as: The set of all elements on the form $f(a)$ such that $a \in A$.

The set builder notation is naturally extended to multiple sets, we write

$$
\{f(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) : a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \ldots a_n \in A_n \}
$$

to mean the set of all elements on the form $f(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ such that $a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \ldots, a_n \in A_n$.
