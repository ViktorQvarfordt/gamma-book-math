:::definition[Index set]
An index set is a set whose elements are used as index for some symbol. Index sets are often totally ordered.

If $I$ is an index set for the symbol $a$, then $a_i$ is defined for each $i \in I$.
:::

:::example
- Common finite index set: $I = \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ for a given $k$.
- Common infinite index set: $I = \mathbb{Z}_+ = \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ and $I = \mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, \ldots\}$.

::::definition[Sequence]

:::definition[Finite sequence]
A _finite sequence_ is a function defined on a finite index set $I$.
:::

:::definition[Infinite sequence]
An _infinite sequence_ is a function defined on an infinite index set $I$.
:::

:::definition[Notation]
- We write $a_n \coloneqq a(n)$ to refer to the $n$th element of a sequence $a$.
- We write $(a_n)_{n=a}^b$ to say that $a$ is a sequence with index set $I = \{a, a + 1, \ldots, b-1, b \}$.
- We write $(a_n)_I$ to say that $a$ is a sequence indexed by $n$ with index set $I$.
- We write $(a_n)_n$ to say that $a$ is a sequence indexed by $n$ with unspecified index set.
:::

:::example
$a_n = n^2$ is a sequence on $\mathbb{Z}_+$, with $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 9, \ldots$
