# Probability space

:::definition[Probability space]
A probability space is a [measure space]() $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ where $P(X) = 1$.

:::intuition
* The set $\Omega$ is called the *sample space* containing all possible outcomes.

* The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ is called the *event space* containing all possible events. An event is a set of outcomes in the sample space.

* The measure $P$ is called the *probability function*, which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number in the range $[0, 1]$.
