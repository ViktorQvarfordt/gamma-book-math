# Bell's theorem

:::theorem[Bell's theorem]
Quantum physics and local hidden-variable theories are incompatible.

::::background[Hidden variables]
It is conceivable that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of nature. There may be _hidden variables_ that, when accounted for, deterministically describe the outcoe

:::example
If a gas is described in terms of temperature, pressure, and volume, then the velocities of the individual atoms in the gas would be hidden variables.
