# Conditional probability

:::definition[Conditional probability (simple)]
Let $A$ and $B$ be events. The probability of observing $A$ given that $B$ occurred is

$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$

:::definition[Conditional probability]
Let $X$ an $Y$ be random variables. The conditional probability is

$$
P_{X|Y}(x_i|y_i) = \frac{P_{X,Y}(x_i,y_j)}{P_Y(y_j)}
$$
