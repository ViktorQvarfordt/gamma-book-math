# Set

:::definition[Set]
A set is a collection of elements such that:

* There is no ordering of the elements.
* There are no duplicate elements.

A set containing elements $a$, $b$ and $c$ is denoted $\{a,b,c\}$.

:::definition[Equality of sets]
Sets are equal [iff]() they contain the same elements, ignoring repetition of elements and ignoring order of elements.
:::

:::example
Since sets are unordered and free from duplicates, we have the following equality

$$
\{c,b,b,a\} = \{a,b,c\}.
$$
