# Tuple

:::definition[Tuple]
A tuple is an ordered list of elements. An $n$-tuple is a tuple of $n$ elements.

A tuple containing elements $a$, $b$ and $c$, in this order, is denoted $(a,b,c)$.

:::example
Because tuples are ordered and may contain duplicates, we have that

$$
(a,b,c) \ne (a,c,b) \quad\text{and}\quad (a,b,c) \ne (a,b,b,c)
$$

in contrast to equality of [sets](set).
