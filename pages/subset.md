# Subset

:::definition[Subset]
Let $A$ and $B$ be [sets](set). $A$ is said to be an subset of $B$ if all elements of $A$ are elements of $B$. We then write $A \subseteq B$. This condition can be expressed as:

$$
A \subseteq B \iff \left( a \in A \implies a \in B \right).
$$

Let $A$ and $B$ be [sets](set). $A$ is said to be a strict subset of $B$, written as $A \subset B$, if the following condition is satisfied.

$$
A \subset B \iff \left(A \subseteq B \quad \text{and} \quad A \ne B\right).
