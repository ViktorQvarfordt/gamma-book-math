# Ring

:::definition[Ring]
A ring $R$ is a [tuple]()
$(A, +, \cdot)$ where $A$ is a [set]()
and $+, \cdot$ are [binary operations](binary-operation)
on $A$ such that:

- $(A, +)$ is an [abelian]() [group]() with [identity element]() $0_R$, the additive identity of $R$.
- $(A, \cdot)$ is a [monoid]() with identity element $1_R$, the multiplicative identity of $R$.
- Multiplication is [distributive]() over addition.
