# Tangent space

:::definition[Tangent space]
The *tangent space* $T_pM$ to $M$ at $p$ is the set of all derivations of $M$ at $p$. An element of $T_pM$ is called a tangent vector at $p$.
:::

:::remark
It is clear that $T_pM$ is a vector space with
$$
\begin{aligned}
(v + w)(f) &= v(f) + w(f) \\
(cv)(f) &= c v(f)
\end{aligned}
$$
for all $v, w \in T_pM$, $f, g \in C^\infty(M)$ and $c\in ‚Ñù$.
