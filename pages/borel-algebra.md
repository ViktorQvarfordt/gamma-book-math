# Borel algebra

:::context
Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space.
:::

:::definition
The collection of all Borel sets on $X$ forms a $σ$-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel $σ$-algebra.

The Borel algebra on $X$ is the smallest $σ$-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).
