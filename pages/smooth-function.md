# Smooth function

:::definition[Smooth function]
A function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is *smooth* if it can be continuously differentiated infinitely many times. That is, $f^{(k)}$ is continuously differentiable for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

The set of smooth functions is denoted $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.
